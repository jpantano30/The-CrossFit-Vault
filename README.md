<summary>Instructions:</summary>
üëâ Start by creating an account and logging in. 
 <br>
üëâ Once logged in, you'll land on the workouts home page. Here, you can browse all available workouts, utilize the search bar to find specific workouts, filter by category, or add a new workout yourself. Clicking on a workout's name will take you to a detailed information page.
 <br>
üëâ On each individual workout page, you have the option to favorite the workout by clicking the star button, add a score, edit the workout details, or delete the workout. Additionally, you can view all scores for that particular workout.
 <br>
üëâ In the navigation bar at the top, you'll find the option to view the Workout of the Day (WOD). If you're not satisfied with the displayed workout, you can regenerate a new WOD.
<br>
üëâ The navigation bar also provides links to the scores page and the favorites page. On the scores page, you can view all recorded scores and delete them if necessary. The favorites page displays all favorited workouts, allowing you to manage your favorites.
<br>
üëâ Finally, to log out, simply click the logout button located at the bottom of the page.

<summary> User Stories:</summary>
 <ul> 
  <li>As a user, I want to click on a workout so that I can see it's full information.</li>
  <li>As a user, I want to be able to search through the workouts so that I can find a particular workout. </li>
  <li>As a user, I want to be able to add a new workout so that I can keep all of my workouts in one place. </li>
  <li>As a user, I want to add my scores for each workout so that I can store all of my scores in one place.</li>
 </ul>
</details>

<details> 
 <summary> Challenges: </summary>
 Descriptions of any unsolved problems or major hurdles that were overcome. 
 <ul>
  <li>Implementing personalized scores: The scores link in the navigation bar displays scores for all users instead of just the logged-in user. </li>
  <li>Troubleshooting routes: There were difficulties with the functionality of routes for the scores page and the favorites page. Although most issues have been resolved, the scores page still needs refinement to display scores exclusively for the logged-in user. </li>
  <li>Managing daily WOD display: A challenge was encountered in ensuring that only one Workout of the Day (WOD) is displayed unless the user chooses to generate a random workout. This functionality is marked for future development. </li>
  <li>Implementing favorites feature: Overcoming the hurdle of creating a favorites button and route involved utilizing a separate front-end JavaScript file to toggle the favorite star button's appearance from white to yellow when favorited.</li>
  <li>Persisting favorites status: Currently, the favorites button does not retain the yellow highlight when a workout has already been favorited by a user. This issue is planned for resolution in future updates.</li>
  <li>Category management: I faced some difficulty in creating categories for each workout to display them properly on the workouts home/index page. I utilized another separate front-end JavaScript file to allow users to switch between categories. </li>
  <li>Consistancy: Some of the routes primarily utilize Mongoose methods, while others leverage JavaScript string and array methods. In the future, I aim to maintain consistency and possibly streamline the approach by standardizing the methods used across all routes.</li>
 </ul>

<summary>Approach Taken:</summary>

üëâ **Database Setup:**
   - MongoDB Atlas was chosen as the database service to store all the information for this project.
   - Collections were created to store user information, workout data, and user scores.
   - Mongoose was used as the library to interact with the MongoDB database.

üëâ **Authentication and Authorization:**
   - User authentication was implemented using bcrypt for password hashing and session management. 
   - Routes were created to handle user registration, login, and logout.

üëâ **Workout Data Management:**
   - Workout data was structured using Mongoose Schemas to define the properties of each workout.
   - Full CRUD operations were implemented to manage workout data.
   - Users are able to view, add, edit, and delete workout entries based on their permissions. 

üëâ **User Interaction:**
   - User interfaces were designed using EJS (Embedded JavaScript) templates to render dynamic content.
   - Forms were created to capture user input for registration, login, and workout management.

 <summary> ‚ùì Future Features </summary>
  Next steps planned: 
 <ul>
  <li>Addressing unresolved issues: Implement fixes for the challenges mentioned above.</li>
  <li>Personalized userScores page: Modify the user scores page to fetch and display only the scores relevant to the current user.</li>
  <li>Leaderboard for Workout of the Day: Introduce a leaderboard page to showcase top performers for the daily workout. Initially, limit the Workout of the Day to one workout per day.</li>
  <li>Profile picture integration: Allow users to upload a profile picture and display it in the top right corner of the navigation bar. If no profile picture is uploaded during signup, a default silhouette image will be used. Utilize multer to handle file uploads.</li>
  <li>User Interation: Implement functionality that allows users to like other users scores.</li>
  <li>Show Page Comments: Allow users to write comments under workouts on the show page for each individual workout so that all users can see. </li>
  <li>Additional Favorite Button: Add the option to favorite the Workout of the Day/WOD from the WOD page and add scores on that page.</li>
 </ul>

<details>
<summary>Notes to Myself: </summary>
 Here are some reminders and thoughts for future reference:
 <ul>
    <li>Understand Heroku better and fix workout information for deployed page. Currently, it is still showing a category for lifting and lifts but I fixed this for local. </li>
    <li>Document any new features or changes made to the project for easier reference later on.</li>
    <li>Plan to implement a feature to allow users to create and customize workout plans. </li>
